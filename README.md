### Completed tasks for Quantum transformer for High Energy Physics Analysis at the LHC

This repository contains the solutions for the given tasks in these links:
- [Task-1](https://github.com/Rohan29032001/QMLHEP2023-tasks_rohan/blob/main/Task_1_ml4sci.ipynb)
- [Task-2](https://github.com/Rohan29032001/QMLHEP2023-tasks_rohan/blob/main/Task_2_QMLHEP.ipynb)
- [Task-3](https://github.com/Rohan29032001/QMLHEP2023-tasks_rohan/blob/main/Task%203%20Open%20Task.ipynb)
- [Task-8](https://github.com/Rohan29032001/QMLHEP2023-tasks_rohan/blob/main/Task_8_QMLHEP.ipynb)

Note: The idea for the Quantum Vision Transformer exists at the bottom of the same .ipynb notebook [here](https://github.com/Rohan29032001/QMLHEP2023-tasks_rohan/blob/main/Task_8_ViT_MNIST-final.ipynb)

Additional files are helper files for the task-2 as they contain the models being implemented there.

As it is evident from the tasks completed, I am interested to contribute to the Quantum Vision Transformer project.
